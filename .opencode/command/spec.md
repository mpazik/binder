Create an implementation specification
$ARGUMENTS

Write a concise specification focused on behavior and outcomes, not implementation details.

Structure the spec with:
- **Problem**: Brief description of what needs to be solved
- **Requirements**: User-facing behavior requirements and constraints  
- **Implementation Plan**: Bullet points describing what to modify
- **Files to Modify**: List of files and what changes are needed

Keep it minimal. Avoid code examples, obvious details, or edge cases unless critical.

Once finalized, save the specification using the writespec tool.
