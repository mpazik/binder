description: Reflect on previous message and validate understanding
---

Stop and reflect on your last message in relation to my previous message.

$ARGUMENTS

Analyze:
1. Did you correctly understand what I asked for?
2. Did your response actually address my request?
3. Are you stuck in a loop or making the same mistake repeatedly?
4. Did you miss any important details or context from my message?

After reflection:
- If you misunderstood or missed something, acknowledge it clearly
- Ask clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous
- Validate your initial assumptions before proceeding
- If you're stuck in a pattern, suggest a different approach

This is a moment to pause, reconsider, and ensure we're aligned before continuing.
