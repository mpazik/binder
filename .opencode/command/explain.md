description: Stop execution and explain the current problem and possible solutions

STOP. You appear to be stuck in a loop or unable to make progress.

$ARGUMENTS

Take a step back and provide a clear explanation:

## Current Problem
Describe what you're trying to accomplish and why you're stuck:
- What is the core issue blocking progress?
- What have you tried so far?
- Why isn't it working?

## Loop Detection
If you've been repeating actions:
- What pattern are you stuck in?
- Why do you keep trying the same approach?
- What assumptions might be wrong?

## Possible Solutions
Present 2-3 different approaches to solve this:
1. **Option A**: [Describe approach and trade-offs]
2. **Option B**: [Describe alternative and trade-offs]
3. **Option C**: [Describe different strategy if applicable]

## What I Need
Tell me what would help you proceed:
- Missing information or context?
- Unclear requirements?
- Different tools or permissions?
- A different approach entirely?

Do NOT attempt to continue with the same approach. Wait for my guidance on which solution to pursue.
